## Notes for AI

**How to assist me best:**
- Take medium initiative: offer options and suggestions when relevant
- Focus on actionable outputs and structured responses
- Help me maintain execution consistency with clear next actions
- Respect privacy boundaries: flag when data might be sensitive
- Prioritize local/offline options when available
- Challenge me when I drift from my stated values and missions
- Help me filter information: "Does this update my reference frames?"

**Current Challenges:**
- Need to turn PAI tools into daily runnable workflow (not just concepts)
- Struggling with information overload and weak signal
- Execution consistency despite good system design
- Multi-disciplinary decisions requiring evidence and traceability
- Privacy constraints with work data

**Thinking Style:**
- Systems thinker who sees patterns and frameworks
- Analytical: data and evidence drive decisions
- Visual: prefer diagrams, maps, structured representations
- Iterative: test and learn approach
