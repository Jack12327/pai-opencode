# InternContext.md

**NOTE:** This file is intentionally minimal.

The Intern agent uses context files from other agents to understand PAI system behavior:
- Agent personality definitions from PAI/Components/
- Agent routing rules from PAI/SYSTEM/PAIAGENTSYSTEM.md
- Core PAI principles from PAI/SKILL.md

This file exists to satisfy the InternContext.md reference but contains no additional content, as the Intern agent's context is derived from shared PAI system files.
