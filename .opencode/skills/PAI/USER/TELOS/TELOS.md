## MISSIONS

Your core life missions - the ultimate purposes that drive everything else.

- **M0**: Build a trustworthy "Personal AI Infrastructure" that turns my life and engineering work into an evolvable system: clearer thinking, faster learning, better decisions, and warmer family life.

- **M1**: Become a top-tier MicroLED advanced packaging engineer (TSV / RDL / a-CSP) who can bridge R&D, suppliers, and execution.

- **M2**: Be a builder: define meaning through systems, craftsmanship, and family care.

---

## GOALS

### Long-term (3–5 years)

- **G0**: Become a recognized expert in MicroLED TSV-based packaging and AR display integration; lead key packaging architecture decisions.

- **G1**: Build a scalable PAI workflow (Heptabase + OpenCode/Codex + ChatGPT) that continuously upgrades my knowledge map and execution loop.

- **G2**: Maintain health and family stability as non-negotiable constraints.

### This Year (12 months)

- **G3**: Deliver measurable impact in TSV/a-CSP development: yield/stress/thermal/DFM improvements + supplier management playbook.

- **G4**: Build a MicroLED Packaging Knowledge Map in Heptabase with weekly updates and reusable templates.

- **G5**: Establish a weekly review + monthly deep work cadence.

### Next 90 Days

- **G6**: Set up TELOS files + memory + skills in PAI-OpenCode; make it usable daily.

- **G7**: Create 3 core workflows: (a) literature → notes → decisions, (b) supplier issue triage, (c) design review checklist.

- **G8**: Ship at least 2 "engineering deliverables" (report/checklist/calculation notebook) reusable by my team.

---

## CHALLENGES

Current obstacles you're working to overcome.

- **C0**: System integration: turning PAI-OpenCode + Heptabase + Codex/ChatGPT into a daily runnable workflow (not just a concept). Need clear file structure, habits, and automation hooks.

- **C1**: Information overload & weak signal: too many inputs (articles, tools, updates). Need strong filtering rule: only keep knowledge that updates reference frames and produces reusable artifacts.

- **C2**: Execution consistency: can design systems, but daily execution slips. Need low-friction routines (daily/weekly reviews) and "next action" prompts.

- **C3**: Work complexity: MicroLED advanced packaging tasks (TSV/RDL/a-CSP) are multi-disciplinary; decisions need evidence, traceability, and fast iteration with suppliers.

- **C4**: Trust & privacy constraints: some work data cannot go to cloud models; need safe local/offline options and clear boundaries for what can be sent to which model.

---

## STRATEGIES

Your approaches to addressing challenges and achieving goals.

- **S0**: Build systems over willpower: design environments, workflows, and automation that make the right actions the easy actions.

- **S1**: Weekly review cadence: structured reflection on progress, blockers, and next actions with clear artifacts.

- **S2**: Reference frame updating: filter all inputs through "does this update my mental models?" Only keep knowledge that produces reusable artifacts.

- **S3**: Local-first architecture: keep sensitive work data in local/offline systems; use cloud models only for sanitized data with clear boundaries.

- **S4**: Ship small, reusable outputs: every piece of work should produce a template, checklist, or calculation notebook that compounds.

---

## PROBLEMS (That I'm Working On)

Problems in the world that you care about and want to help solve.

- **P0**: Knowledge work inefficiency: engineers spend too much time searching for information and recreating solutions that already exist.

- **P1**: MicroLED packaging complexity: the gap between R&D concepts and manufacturing reality creates costly iteration cycles.

- **P2**: AI adoption friction: professionals know AI can help but struggle to integrate it into existing workflows.

---

## NARRATIVES (My Active Talking Points)

Your key messages and perspectives that you share with others.

- **N0**: "I'm building an AI-assisted engineering practice that turns knowledge work into a compounding system—clearer thinking, faster decisions, and reusable outputs."

- **N1**: "MicroLED advanced packaging isn't just about process steps—it's about bridging R&D vision with supplier reality through rigorous evidence and traceable decisions."

- **N2**: "The best engineers don't just solve problems; they build systems that prevent problems and enable others to solve them faster."

- **N3**: "Prediction errors are the best teachers—every surprise is a signal to update your mental model."

---

## BELIEFS

Core beliefs that guide your decisions and worldview.

- **B0**: Truth-seeking over comfort; evidence beats vibes.

- **B1**: Systems over willpower; design environments and workflows.

- **B2**: Craftsmanship: ship real outputs, not just ideas.

- **B3**: Family warmth is sacred; health is a prerequisite.

- **B4**: Long-term compounding: small daily upgrades beat heroic sprints.

- **B5**: Prediction errors are teachers; surprises are signals for model updates.

- **B6**: Knowledge must update reference frames, otherwise it's noise.

- **B7**: Documentation is immortality of structure: write it down, version it, reuse it.

---

## FRAMES (Useful Ways of Seeing the World)

Perspectives and mental models that help you navigate life.

- **FR0**: **The Builder Frame**: I define meaning through creating systems, artifacts, and structures that outlast the moment.

- **FR1**: **The Reference Frame**: Every piece of information should either update my mental models or produce a reusable artifact; everything else is noise.

---

## MODELS (How the World Works)

Your understanding of how things work - your mental models.

- **MO0**: **Compounding Systems**: Small daily improvements in knowledge, workflows, and decisions compound into massive advantages over time.

- **MO1**: **Evidence-Based Engineering**: Good decisions require traceable evidence, clear reasoning, and documented assumptions that can be tested.

- **MO2**: **The Integration Gap**: The most expensive problems occur at the intersection of domains (R&D ↔ suppliers, theory ↔ practice, design ↔ manufacturing).

---

## TRAUMAS (Formative Experiences)

Experiences that shaped who you are. Being honest about these helps you understand your patterns.

- **TR0**: *[To be added as you reflect]*

- **TR1**: *[To be added as you reflect]*

---

## LESSONS (Hard-Won Wisdom)

Lessons you've learned through experience. Add to this as you learn.

- Documentation created today saves hours of reconstruction tomorrow.
- Systems that require willpower will eventually fail; design for the lazy version of yourself.
- The best time to update your mental models is when you encounter a surprise, not when it's comfortable.

---

## WISDOM (Aphorisms and Collected Insights)

Quotes, aphorisms, and insights that resonate with you.

- "Documentation is immortality of structure."
- "Ship real outputs, not just ideas."
- "Systems over willpower."
